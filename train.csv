Effective immediately, Part II of each Fund's Statement of Additional Information is amended as follows:</text>
The following paragraph is added at the end of the section entitled Investment Risks and Considerations Borrowing and Leverage:</text>
To the extent permitted by a Fund's investment policies and restrictions and subject to the conditions of an  exemptive order issued by the SEC, as described below under Investment Risks and Considerations  Interfund  Lending Program;, such Fund may borrow for temporary purposes through the Interfund Lending Program (as  defined below).</text>
The following is added as a new subsection under Investment Risks and Considerations:</text>
Interfund Lending Program.</text>
Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the SEC (the IFL Order), a Fund, to  the extent permitted by its investment policies and restrictions and subject to meeting the conditions of the IFL  Order, has the ability to lend money to, and borrow money from, another Fund pursuant to a master interfund  lending agreement (the Interfund Lending Program).</text>
Under the Interfund Lending Program, the Funds may  lend or borrow money for temporary purposes directly to or from other Funds (an Interfund Loan).</text>
All  Interfund Loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending Fund otherwise would invest in  short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments.</text>
Although Funds that are money market funds  may, to the extent permitted by their investment policies, participate in the Interfund Lending Program as  borrowers or lenders, they typically will not need to participate as borrowers because they are required to comply  with the liquidity provisions of Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.</text>
If a Fund has outstanding bank borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund would: (a) be at an interest rate  equal to or lower than that of any outstanding bank loan, (b) be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at  least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral,  (c) have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and  (d) provide that, if an event of default occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the  Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute  an immediate event of default under the interfund lending agreement, entitling the lending Fund to call the  Interfund Loan immediately (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral), and cause such call to be  made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.</text>
A Fund may borrow on an unsecured basis through the Interfund Lending Program only if its outstanding  borrowings from all sources immediately after the borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if  the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the  Fund&#8217;s borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of  collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral.</text>
If a borrowing Fund&#8217;s total outstanding  borrowings immediately after an Interfund Loan under the Interfund Lending Program exceed 10% of its total  assets, the Fund may borrow through the Interfund Lending Program on a secured basis only.</text>
A Fund may not  borrow under the Interfund Lending Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings  immediately after the borrowing would be more than 33 1&#8260;3% of its total assets or any lower threshold provided  for by the Fund&#8217;s investment restrictions.</text>
No Fund may lend to another Fund through the Interfund Lending Program if the loan would cause the lending  Fund's aggregate outstanding loans through the Interfund Lending Program to exceed 15% of its current net  assets at the time of the loan.</text>
A Fund's Interfund Loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending  Fund's net assets.
The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for  securities sold, but in no event more than seven days, and for purposes of this condition, loans effected within  seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions.
Each Interfund Loan may be called on one  business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
The limitations described above and the other conditions of the IFL Order permitting interfund lending are  designed to minimize the risks associated with interfund lending for both the lending Fund and the borrowing Fund.
However, no borrowing or lending activity is without risk.
When a Fund borrows money from another Fund under the Interfund Lending Program, there is a risk that the Interfund Loan could be called on one day's  notice, in which case the borrowing Fund may have to borrow from a bank at higher rates if an Interfund Loan is not available from another Fund.
Interfund Loans are subject to the risk that the borrowing Fund could be unable  to repay the loan when due, and a delay in repayment to a lending Fund could result in a lost opportunity or  additional lending costs.
No Fund may borrow more than the amount permitted by its investment restrictions.
Shareholders should retain this Supplement for future reference.
